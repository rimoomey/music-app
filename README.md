# music-app
Music application created for the Flatiron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp Phase 1 project.

The goal of this project was to create a music search application which allows the user to search for a particular artist and save the information on songs
they particularly enjoy. The api in usage is MusicBrainz, as well as a mock database which lives in the project repository, used for persisting favorite
songs. The application also allows the playback of Youtube videos, which a user can associate with a particular song and save for later viewing.

This project was written by Sam Lee and Rimon Moomey.

Currently availabe for preview at https://rimoomey.github.io/music-app
